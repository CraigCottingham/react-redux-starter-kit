## Scripts
* `npm start` - Start the dev server and watch for changes
* `npm run lint` - Lints all files.
* `npm run lint:fix` - Lints all files and attempts to fix any issues.
* `npm test` - Runs unit tests.
* `npm run test:watch` - Same as `npm test` but watches files for changes.
* `npm run test:cov` - Generates a test coverage report.

## Commitizen
 `react-redux-starter-kit` uses [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to format commit messages.
 * Install it globally `$ npm install -g commitizen`
Once you are ready to commit, follow the familiar github workflow, with a slight change.
```
$ git add <files>
$ git cz
```
`git cz` will bring up the Commitizen commit prompt, follow the instructions, and `$ git push` as usual.
